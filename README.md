This repository has the code to extract data from Twitter, based on a HASHTAG. Then, from this data, clean, prepare and transform it in a Table and Word Cloud.

You can follow the R Notebook with each piece of code and explanation in the document [WordCloud_code.md](https://github.com/alemoraescarv/R_WordCloud_Twitter/blob/master/WordCloud_code.md) or the whole code itself in the document [code.txt](https://github.com/alemoraescarv/R_WordCloud_Twitter/blob/master/code_wordCloud.rtf).
